// The ability AI: lets NPC pawns (raiders, visitors, tamed animals, mechs) cast abilities with some judgement.
//
// STANDALONE ON PURPOSE. Nothing in this folder may reference an Entad type: it is meant to be copied into another
// mod (Bastle Framework) or a shared library as it is. The host mod plugs in through three things only:
// - IAbilityAIHook, registered with AbilityAIHooks.Register, which claims or vetoes abilities per pawn and hears
//   about each cast the AI starts;
// - AbilityAISettings.ExposeData / DoSettings, called from the host's own ModSettings and settings window;
// - the EF_AI_ keys in Languages/English/Keyed/AbilityAI.xml. A copy in another mod must rename that prefix (and this
//   namespace), or the two mods' keyed strings collide.
// The Harmony patch class at the bottom is picked up by whatever patching the host does ([HarmonyPatch] on the class).
//
// How an ability opts in: an AbilityAIExtension on its AbilityDef naming a worker class (AbilityAIWorkers.cs). No
// extension, no AI casts. Vanilla's own aiCanUse flag is deliberately NOT required: it is also what vanilla's fight
// AI (JobGiver_AIFightEnemy.GetAbilityJob) and JobGiver_NPCCastNonCombatAbilities read, and those cast anything
// offensive straight at the current enemy, or anything else at random. Abilities using this AI keep aiCanUse off so
// vanilla leaves them alone. Every other vanilla gate still applies: CanCast (charges, cooldown, comps), CanApplyOn,
// each effect comp's AICanTargetNow, and the verb's own ValidateTarget (range, line of sight, target rules).
//
// Two copies of this code in two mods would each patch the same method; that is harmless as long as each one only
// casts what its own hooks claim. With "unclaimed abilities" on in both, a pawn could be evaluated twice.
