// Workers decide WHETHER an ability is worth casting now and AT WHAT. Each is a category, not an ability: an
// AbilityDef picks one with AbilityAIExtension.workerClass and tunes it with the extension's fields. Workers are
// shared between pawns and must keep no per-pawn state. Standalone like the rest of this folder: no Entad types.
//
// Cost: a worker only runs for a pawn that is not a colonist, holds an ability with an extension, that ability is
// ready (CanCast, reserve, gap) and a host hook claims it, at most once per 30 ticks per pawn and then not again for
// the global gap after a cast. Each worker notes its own cost below; k = hostile pawns on the map.
